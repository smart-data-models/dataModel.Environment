Global description: **The Data Model is intended to measure, observe and control the level and quality of groundwater at a given time (T), by a fixed or mobile monitoring system. Depending on the device used, it is also possible to measure the quality of water such as its electrical conductivity, its salt content, its temperature, etc. In this case, the values measured are processed by the Data Model `WaterObserved` and `WaterQualityObserved`. Additional Information about Attributes: For attributes dedicated to water, a MetaData attribute can also be used. it contains the `TimeStamp` in seconds, the `qualification` and control `status` of the measurement.**  

## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateObserved`: The date and time of this observation in ISO8601 UTC format  - `dateObservedFrom`: Observation period : Start date and time in an ISO8601 UTC format  - `dateObservedTo`: Observation period : End date and time in an ISO8601 UTC format  - `depth`: Depth of drinking water, since its identification `waterTable`. The unit code (text) of measurement given using the [UN/CEFACT Common Codes](http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documentation/UN/CEFACT_Common_Codes) (max. 3 characters). For instance, <code> MTR </code> represents Meter.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `investigationDepth`: Maximum depth where the investigation was made.

For instance, <code>MTR</code> represents Meter  - `isMobile`: The device used is Fixed (False) or Mobile (True)  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `measurementType`: Observation period : Type of measurement processed. Enum:'depth, volume, quality, other'  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `pollutionRate`: Rate of pollution. The unit code (text) of measurement given using the [UN/CEFACT Common Codes](http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documentation/UN/CEFACT_Common_Codes) (max. 3 characters). For instance, P1 represents Percentage.  - `pressure`: Water Pressure. The unit code (text) of measurement given using the [UN/CEFACT Common Codes](http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documentation/UN/CEFACT_Common_Codes) (max. 3 characters). For instance, <code>BAR</code> represents Bar.  - `refDevice`: Reference to the devices providing data  - `residueLevel`: Residue level found  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI Entity type. It has to be PhreaticObserved  - `waterTable`: Level at which water was found during this investigation. The unit code (text) of measurement given using the [UN/CEFACT Common Codes](http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documentation/UN/CEFACT_Common_Codes) (max. 3 characters).

#### PhreaticObserved NGSI-v2 key-values Example    
Here is an example of a PhreaticObserved in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.
